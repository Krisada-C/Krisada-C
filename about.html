                    <p><h3>About Me</h3></p>
                    <p>Hi, my name is Isagi Yoichi. I was a second-year student at Ichinan High School that played for the school's football team. Along with many other young and talented players like me, we were invited to "Blue Lock". Following a heartbreaking defeat I faced, I was given a second chance to become a soccer player. Without any hesitance, I joined the Blue Lock program to become the ultimate striker. Through challenges and matches, I'm discovering my true potential, proving myself with every goal. My journey is about resilience and perseverance, inspiring others to chase their dreams with passion. </p>
